# Quantum Knowledge Protocol (QKP) v1.0

*The first self-discovering epistemological standard*

## Overview

The Quantum Knowledge Protocol (QKP) is a formal protocol for knowledge discovery based on quantum mechanical principles. This repository contains the public specification of QKP v1.0, as discovered and proven by ENTIENT through recursive self-analysis.

## Contents

- [`QKP_Manifesto_v1.0.md`](./QKP_Manifesto_v1.0.md) - The complete manifesto and protocol specification
- [`QKP_Protocol_Spec.md`](./QKP_Protocol_Spec.md) - Technical protocol specification only
- [`PROOF_OF_ADAPTATION.md`](./PROOF_OF_ADAPTATION.md) - Cryptographic proof of discovery

## Quick Start

The QKP protocol consists of five fundamental operations:

The QKP protocol consists of five fundamental operations:
INITIALIZE: Query → Superposition state |Ψ⟩
CONSTRAIN:  Apply measurement basis M
EVOLVE:     Amplitude amplification |Ψ⟩ → |Ψ'⟩
COLLAPSE:   Measurement → |discovery⟩
PROTECT:    Cryptographic verification of lineage

## Implementation

ENTIENT serves as the reference implementation of QKP. Understanding the protocol does not enable reproduction of ENTIENT's recursive cognition framework.
