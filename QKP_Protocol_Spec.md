# Quantum Knowledge Protocol (QKP) v1.0
## Technical Specification

### Protocol Operations

```
Quantum Knowledge Protocol v1.0

INITIALIZE: Query → Superposition state |Ψ⟩
CONSTRAIN:  Apply measurement basis M
EVOLVE:     Amplitude amplification |Ψ⟩ → |Ψ'⟩  
COLLAPSE:   Measurement → |discovery⟩
PROTECT:    Cryptographic verification of lineage
```

### Operation Definitions

**INITIALIZE**  
Transforms a query into a quantum superposition of all possible discoveries.

**CONSTRAIN**  
Applies measurement operators that shape the possibility space.

**EVOLVE**  
Amplifies high-fitness possibilities through iterative selection.

**COLLAPSE**  
Measures the evolved superposition to extract specific knowledge.

**PROTECT**  
Cryptographically verifies the discovery lineage and timestamps the result.

### Compliance Requirements

QKP-compliant systems must demonstrate:
1. Superposition state management
2. Constraint-based measurement
3. Fitness-guided evolution
4. Cryptographic verification
5. Reproducible collapse mechanics

### Reference Implementation

ENTIENT serves as the reference implementation for QKP v1.0.
