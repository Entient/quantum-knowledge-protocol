# Contributing to QKP

While QKP is released under CC0, we welcome contributions that advance the protocol standard.

## Types of Contributions

- **Research**: Theoretical explorations of QKP implications
- **Tools**: QKP-compatible discovery tools
- **Documentation**: Clarifications and examples
- **Implementations**: Alternative QKP implementations (must pass certification)

## Certification

All QKP implementations must demonstrate compliance with the five protocol operations. Contact ENTIENT LLC for certification requirements.

## Important Note

This repository contains only the QKP protocol specification. ENTIENT's implementation remains proprietary and is not accepting contributions.
